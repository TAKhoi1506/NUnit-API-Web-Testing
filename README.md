# Unit, Web & API Testing Project  

This project was developed as a personal practice to gain hands-on experience in **software testing**, covering **unit testing**, **web UI automation**, and **API testing**.  

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C# (.NET), SQL  
- **Testing Tools:** NUnit, Selenium WebDriver, Postman, JSON Server  
- **Others:** Visual Studio, GitHub  

## Features
- **Unit Testing (NUnit):**  
  - Implemented calculation logic in C#.  
  - Designed and executed **10 test cases** (normal, boundary, exception cases).  
  - Verified correctness using assertions (6 passed, 4 failed).  

- **Web UI Testing (Selenium WebDriver):**  
  - Automated test cases on [Nhà Thuốc Long Châu](https://nhathuoclongchau.com.vn/).  
  - Test scenarios: product search, add-to-cart, image-based search, advanced filtering.  
  - Applied **XPath/CSS selectors**, handled **AJAX requests** and **dynamic elements**.  

- **API Testing (Postman):**  
  - Created and organized Postman collections.  
  - Tested **CRUD operations** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).  
  - Used **environment variables** and **mock data** with JSON Server.  

## Results
- Unit Tests: 10 cases → 6 Passed, 4 Failed (edge cases included).  
- Web UI Tests: Validated multiple user scenarios on e-commerce website.  
- API Tests: Successfully tested endpoints with Postman, handled both positive and negative cases.  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open project in **Visual Studio** (for NUnit & Selenium).  
3. Run test cases via **Test Explorer**.  
4. For API Testing, import the Postman collection and run with JSON Server.

### Learning Outcome
Through this project, I practiced designing test cases, automating test scripts, handling test data, and reporting results — strengthening both **manual testing mindset** and **automation skills**.
